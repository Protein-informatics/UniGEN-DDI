UniGEN-DDI: Computing drug-drug interactions using a unified graph embedding network

# Problem Statement

Given the information about two drugs, predict if the will be
interacting with each other, based on the known interacting data and
their different unique features.

# Problem Formulation

We break the problem into two parts.

1.  Generating embeddings for the drugs, which describe its features.
2.  From the generated embeddings, create a classifier, which finds, if
    there is an interaction between the drugs.
