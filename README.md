UniGEN-DDI: Computing drug-drug interactions using a unified graph embedding network

#Setup
* We require python3 and other supporting libraries for running these codes.
* rgcn_env.yml (GraphSAGE and Node2Vec) and oldenv.yml (UniGEN-DDI) contain the supporting environments to run these codes.

#How to run?
* Generate embeddings by running GraphSAGE.py and Node2Vec.py.
* Run UniGENDDI.py for DDIs predictions.
